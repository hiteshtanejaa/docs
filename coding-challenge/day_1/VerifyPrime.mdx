### Given a number N, verify if N is prime or not.
### Return 1 if N is prime, else return 0.

Example :

Input : 7

Output : True

```python code.py
    def isPrime(N):
        if N <= 1:
            return 0
        if N <= 3:
            return 1

        # If N is divisible by 2 or 3, it's not prime
        if N % 2 == 0 or N % 3 == 0:
            return 0

        # Check for divisors from 5 to sqrt(N)
        i = 5
        while i * i <= N:
            if N % i == 0 or N % (i + 2) == 0:
                return 0
            i += 6

        return 1
```
## Explaination
Python function isPrime(N) that determines whether a given number N is a prime number or not. The function returns 0 if the number is not prime and 1 if it is prime. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. Check for Numbers Less Than or Equal to 1:
The function begins by checking if N is less than or equal to 1. In mathematics, prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Therefore, numbers less than or equal to 1 are not considered prime. If N is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 0 (not prime).

2. Check for Numbers 2 and 3:
Next, the function checks if N is less than or equal to 3. Since 2 and 3 are prime numbers, if N is 2 or 3, the function returns 1 (prime).

3. Divisibility by 2 or 3:
The function then checks if N is divisible by 2 or 3. This is because all prime numbers greater than 3 are not divisible by 2 or 3. If N is divisible by either 2 or 3, it is not a prime number, and the function returns 0.

4. Checking for Other Divisors:
    - The function proceeds to check for possible divisors of N starting from 5. This is done using a while loop, which continues as long as the square of i (the current divisor being tested) is less than or equal to N.
    - Inside the loop, the function checks if N is divisible by i or i + 2. This step is based on the fact that after 2 and 3, all prime numbers are of the form 6k ± 1, where k is an integer. Therefore, it checks for divisibility with i and i + 2 where i starts from 5 and is incremented by 6 in each iteration (5, 11, 17, 23, ...).
    - If N is found to be divisible by either i or i + 2, it is not a prime number, and the function returns 0.

5. Returning Prime Status:
If the function does not find any divisors of N in the above steps, it concludes that N is a prime number and returns 1.

In summary, the isPrime(N) function efficiently checks whether a given number N is prime by first handling edge cases and then using the property that all primes are of the form 6k ± 1 for k > 0, thus reducing the number of divisibility checks needed.
